This is a simple web application that presents a list of users, allows to create, edit and
remove each user in the list.


Backend

- runs on your laptop

- http server uses nodejs

- uses REST API for CRUD operations

- has hardcoded initial list of users (no need to use files / DB), each time backend restarts

it is initiated with the same list of hardcoded users

- we encourage you to use modules and/or extra tools/libraries you want, make sure you

can explain what each of them does and why did you use it



Front end

- runs on BackboneJS

- when no users exist in list, shows some message

- no console errors

- we encourage you to use modules and/or extra tools/libraries you want, but you’ll need

to explain what each of them does and why did you use it



Misc

- Build backend API points according to REST best practices

- Use proper HTTP requests

- Data between server and client should be consistent as much as possible

- Don’t mess with styling - build something clear and straightforward (see example below)

- No page reloads after initial loading

- Open an account on github and commit as you advance through the task, so we’ll be

able to see your progress :] (not must, but if you do, send us a link)



Bonus:

- Write few unit and functionality tests
